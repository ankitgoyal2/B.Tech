   <h2>1. Air Pollution</h2>
   <p style="font-size: 25px;">The most significant demerit of fireworks is the pollution that it causes in the area
	 where it is done excessively. Also, the crackers emit carbon dioxide which is a greenhouse gas thereby alarming 
	 the global warming effects. During diwali, the amount of air pollution increases up to 50% as compared to normal 
	 days which is indeed a considerable situation as it can cause many heart and lung diseases. Also, the people already
	  suffering form these diseases are highly disturbed!
	</p>
	<h2>2. Garbage</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 25px;">The garbage of the crackers which is left over after the enjoyment is a major problem to
		 be considered. The left overs are chemical wastes lying on roads, gardens and parks. These chemical wastes can do
		  a lot more damage than we can even imagine. If accidentally inhaled, can even cause death.</p>
	<h2>3. Smog</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 25px;">The air we breathe no longer remains pure. Diwali crackers are a major cause for the smog
		 suspended in the atmosphere. There is low visibility which can be a cause for many major road accidents. Also, the
		  smog effects the respiratory system so badly that it can take lives very easily. India is a country highly affected
		   by global warming, in such a situation smog only makes the atmosphere worse.</p>
